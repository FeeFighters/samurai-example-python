    <h2>Samurai.js Katana Sword</h2>
    <img src='katana_sword.jpg' width="50" height="100"/>
    <p>
      This razor-sharp sword will cut through all of your API integration headaches.
      It provides AJAX-powered payments with simple, drop-in forms that you can customize
      with ease. PCI compliance is a cinch, because the credit card data never touches your server.

    <h2>Server-to-Server Battle Axe</h2>
    <img src='battle-axe.jpg' width="50" height="100"/>
    <p>
      Sometimes you just need to hack your way through. For these situations, our server-to-server
      battle axe API is precisely the right tool for the job. Simply POST the credit card details to your
      server, and process the transaction on the backend.
      <em>(Note: those pesky PCI-compliance ninjas are sure to harass you with this approach, but you can handle it.</em>

    <h2>Transparent Redirect Nunchucks</h2>
    <img src='nunchucks.jpg' width="50" height="100"/>
    <p>
      These nunchunks come bundled with our Transparent Redirect process, a simple pure-HTML method for
      processing payments without letting the credit cards touch your server.
      You point the payment form at Samurai's secure servers, and we send back a token that you can
      use to process transactions. Simple, effective, <em>deadly</em>.
